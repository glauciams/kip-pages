# KIP Big Picture - Trip Planning Procedure

Planning a trip is a common activity nowadays. A typical scenario requires activities such as:

 - defining the itinerary;
 - defining the start and end dates;
 - deciding on the number of travelers;
 - booking the airline;
 - booking a place to stay;
 - reserving a car;
 - reserving attractions;
 - buying insurance;
