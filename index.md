# Introduction

Processes are important concepts in modern society since they control and standardize the interactions between businesses, consumers, governments and other organizations. Tasks, roles, artifacts and relationships are central abstractions used in processes to explicitly define models for possible execution flows. However, the rise of knowledge-based industries such as financial, healthcare, software development and insurance, imposes the adoption of agile processes that do not constrain knowledge workersâ€™ decisions at runtime. The interplay between agility and unconstrained behavior promotes the emergence of complex and unpredictable work-graphs [1], gathering cross-cutting processes, tasks, people, information, rules and supporting software systems, a scenario in which representing, controlling and standardizing process abstractions is challenging.

Literature from process management brings the concept of Knowledge Intensive Processes (KIPs) [2] as being collaborative, goal-oriented, knowledge dependent and non-repeatable. KIPs can range from partially structured processes occurring when the overall workflow is not explicitly defined, but the existence of policies and regulations supports the identification of structured fragments; to unstructured processes appearing when the participants define the activities to be executed. As a result, KIPs abstractions are present in modern organization-to-individual interactions and capture the complexity imposed by the processes found in knowledge-based industries.

This research agenda plans to address important challenges found in the literature related to: KIP Modelling - How to model KIP abstractions? [7]; KIP Navigation - How to help knowledge workers follow complex and unstructured process? [2]; and KIP Compliance - How to assess process compliance? [8][9]. KIP Modeling attempts to represent processes and although there is extensive research on process languages as with BPMN [10], CMMN [11], Adept[13] and YAWL[14], they fail to comply with the requirements for modeling KIPs such as goals, knowledge workers and rules. KIP Navigation is challenging and is related to knowledge workers properly following the workflow paths at runtime, from task to task [2]. Given the complex and unpredictable nature of work-graphs consisting of a multitude of cross-cutting process fragments, current solutions to support navigation [15] fail to support knowledge workers avoiding paths that lead to risks and anomalies.
KIP compliance is also complex in a scenario where rules and policies need to be integrated with process abstractions in flexible ways and assessed as per the knowledge worker discretion, differently from [12].

Our research to KIP challenges is novel and it explores the convergence of standard process modelling languages, machine learning and process mining [16] as we have used previously to support the collaborative framework instantiation process [18][19] and software process tailoring [17][4].
