# Trip Planning Procedure

## The Big Picture

Planning a trip is a common activity nowadays. A typical scenario requires activities such as:

 - defining the itinerary;
 - defining the start and end dates;
 - deciding on the number of travelers;
 - booking the airline;
 - booking a place to stay;
 - reserving a car;
 - reserving attractions;
 - buying insurance;

To  facilitate the Trip Planning Procedure one might just set the initial parameters (itinerary, dates, travelers), negotiate everything with a travel agency or buy a pre-packaged trip (what is the fun in that!!!).  A more adventurous traveler might enjoy the do-it-yourself approach and spend hours, if not days, navigating on several websites to better understand the options available and create a bespoke traveling experience. Maybe the dates are flexible and the travelers can fly on cheaper flights! Maybe the itinerary is flexible and the travelers might be able to explore local hidden gems! Maybe, after you bragging about your travel plans on a family Sunday lunch, gramma decides to jump in!

In order to organize the Trip Planning Procedure and keep things under control this adventurous traveler may create a simple TODO list with the required activities.  The list might be executed as per the traveler discretion but some rules must be followed such as setting the initial parameters (itinerary, dates, travelers) upfront. Fig.1 brings a [BPMN](http://www.bpmn.org/) process model (Business Processes Modeling and Notation) to represent the TODO list in a "sophisticated" way. The model tries to define a streamlined flow of activities from the process starting point (Start Planning Trip) to the process endpoint (Travelers Ready to Travel).  However, defining such flow seems complex: What should one do first? Reserve the Place? or Reserve the Airline?; How may times can one execute the same activity to accommodate a new demand?
To give a simple answer to these questions: it all depends on the traveler's context. The context maybe simple if the traveler is traveling alone, which makes easier to make decisions. The context maybe complex, involving several travelers with different needs (remember gramma!). As a result, creating a on-fits-all model seems unproductive.

It is important to understand the Trip Planning Procedure is supported by an IT infrastructure with several different software systems (e.g. several websites) that will be dynamically integrated (sometimes agnostically ) by the traveler and forcing a pre-established flow of activities may ...

A better way to represent the Trip Planning Procedure is using the Knowledge Intensive Process paradigm where the process model indicates an accepted flow of activities. However, the traveler is free to combine the activities to fit his/her needs. In this scenario, some other question arise: How do I pass on my Trip Planning Procedure experience? How do I learn from planning several trips? How do I combine several trip planning experiences? and recommend the most successful ones?
