# Introduction

Processes are important concepts in modern society since they control and standardize the interactions between businesses, consumers, governments and other organizations. Tasks, roles, artifacts and relationships are central abstractions used in processes to explicitly define models for possible execution flows. However, the rise of knowledge-based industries such as financial, healthcare, software development and insurance, imposes the adoption of agile processes that do not constrain knowledge workersâ€™ decisions at runtime. The interplay between agility and unconstrained behavior promotes the emergence of complex and unpredictable work-graphs [1], gathering cross-cutting processes, tasks, people, information, rules and supporting software systems, a scenario in which representing, controlling and standardizing process abstractions is challenging.

Literature from process management brings the concept of Knowledge Intensive Processes (KIPs) [2] as being collaborative, goal-oriented, knowledge dependent and non-repeatable. KIPs can range from partially structured processes occurring when the overall workflow is not explicitly defined, but the existence of policies and regulations supports the identification of structured fragments; to unstructured processes appearing when the participants define the activities to be executed. As a result, KIPs abstractions are present in modern organization-to-individual interactions and capture the complexity imposed by the processes found in knowledge-based industries.

This website intends to analyze the Knowledge Intensive Processes (KIPs) lifecycle and discuss how KIPs are modeled and executed. A process lifecycle can be seen as a collection of _stages_ and associated _operations_ that allow intra or inter stages transitions. A _Process Stage_ can be defined as a place sharing common definitions such as a common metamodel or the same representation language. For example a Java program may seen as having two stages, one as the Java source-code and another as the Java byte-code. The Java source-code is defined by the [Java grammar](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-18.html) while the Java byte-code has it's own [file format](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html).
 _Transitions_  can be defined as operations allowing files moving from one stage to another (inter stage transition) or staying in the same stage with a different configuration (intra stage transition). Going back to the Java program example we can see the Java compiler as an inter stage transition as it compiles Java source-code into Java byte-code. On the other hand, a Java refactoring tool can be seen as an intra stage transition as the input and output files are both Java source-code.  
 Using stages and transitions abstractions to understand the lifecycle for knowledge intensive processes allows us to isolate and dissect concepts according to an specific rationale, and provide a didactical and systematic way to explore the phenomena. Moreover, stages and transitions abstractions are commonly used in Model Driven Engineering so we can leverage on some of their frameworks and tools.    


# Motivating Examples

Knowledge Intensive Processes are everywhere but sometimes they are recognized as simple prescriptive processes. By prescriptive processes we mean processes that can be executed as is, such as in a car assembly line. However modern processes typically support individuals in achieving their goals and typically deviate from the original model to accommodate specific and unplanned needs. In order to better expose the KIP phenomenon this section brings several motivating examples to expose how process are in fact complex and non-deterministic.
